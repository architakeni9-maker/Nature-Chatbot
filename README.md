# Nature-Chatbot
An interactive chatbot that helps identify birds and plants using AI-powered image analysis and provides detailed information about them.

I've created an interactive Nature Identifier chatbot for you! Here's what it can do:
Features:

📸 Image Upload: Upload photos of birds or plants for instant identification
💬 Text Chat: Ask questions about specific species or general nature topics
🔍 Detailed Information: Get comprehensive details including:

Common and scientific names
Key identifying features
Natural habitat and locations
Behavior/growing conditions
Life expectancy
Fun facts

How to use it:

Click the green upload button to select an image of a bird or plant
Or type questions in the chat box (e.g., "Tell me about cardinals" or "What is a monstera plant?")
The AI will analyze the image or answer your question with detailed, helpful information
